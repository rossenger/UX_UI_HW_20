              <h2>Project Summary</h2>
              <p>As part of our UX/UI design boot camp, our team was tasked with redesigning a non-profit organization's website. We were given 3 weeks to complete this design challenge.</p>
              <p>Our team selected the White Bear Area Food Shelf website to redesign, and our goal was to improve its usability and informational hierarchy to better serve the mission of eliminating food insecurity in the White Bear area.</p>
              <p>After creating a responsive website redesign for the White Bear Area Food shelf, we presented our design process to our boot camp cohort and supported our findings and final prototypes with the following deliverables: proto-persona, UX research interview plan, Google Survey findings, brainstorming and feature prioritization matrix, user scenario, journey map, heuristic evaluation, user flow, low fidelity wireframes and prototypes, usability testing plan and findings, style guide, medium-fidelity wireframes and prototypes, style guide, and high-fidelity prototypes.</p>

  <h2>User Research</h2>
</div>

<div class="pContainer">
  <p>When tasked with selecting a non-profit organization, our team settled on the White Bear Area Food Shelf quite easily. It is no secret that food insecurity is an enormous problem space and it is a cause that we can all get behind. To make the selection even easier, one of team members knows the food shelf director, allowing opportunities to work with a stakeholder to implement changes to the site in the future. After viewing the current website, it was obvious that there were ample opportunities for improvement and to make a difference in our local community.</p>
  <p>After selecting our food shelf, our team set out to discover what challenges currently exist for patrons when accessing resources at the food shelf. We put together a plan for qualitative and quantitative research, however we encountered our first obstacle when interviewing the food shelf director. We asked permission to interview patrons, however he expressed reservations due to privacy concerns so we pivoted and reached out to others who have had experience utilizing resources at other food shelves in the area. Below, you can see some of the questions we asked users.</p>
</div>

<div class="pContainer">
<h3>User Interview Questions</h3>
</div>

<div class="pContainer">
  <ul>
    <li>What are the main methods people use to access the food shelf you worked with?</li>
    <li>What are the main challenges you've noticed with people accessing a food shelf?</li>
    <li>What areas of improvement do you see with helping folks connect with a food shelf?</li>
    <li>What types of information do you think are essential in including on a website for helping people find a food shelf?</li>
    <li>What have you found to be most important for people when accessing a food shelf?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="pContainer">
  <h3>Interview Takeaways & Pain Points</h3>
</div>

<div class="pContainer">
  <ul>
    <li class="normalList">We learned that all users want to <span>access the most vital information first</span> for accessing food shelf resources</li>
    <li class="normalList">All users emphasized the <span>need for mobile accessibility</span> as current mobile websites theyâ€™ve experienced have been cumbersome to use and make it difficult to access the information they need</li>
    <li class="normalList">Two-thirds of users expressed that having a <span>language preference</span> on the website is desired and would help with accessibility</li>
    <li class="normalList">All users touched on challenges with <span>transportation accessibility</span> and a need for delivery service</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="pContainer">
  <h3>Survey</h3>
  <p>In addition to our qualitative research, we conducted quantitative research in the form of a Google Survey that we posted to a public food shelf Facebook page.</p>
  <p>From the 19 responses we received, we found that having an easily accessible mobile website is critical as more than half of users surveyed prefer using their phones for accessing a food shelf. This further supports our findings from our user interviews. </p>
  <p>Additionally, we knew moving forward that we must make important information such as date/time of food-pick up, location, and pick-up instructions front and center on the website and easy to find. </p>
  <p>Lastly, while just under three-quarters of users reported not needing a language preference, over a quarter of users still expressed the need for the website supporting multiple languages.</p>
